The One- to Four-Family Home Performance with ENERGY STAR® Program is a market transformation program that uses Building Performance Institute (BPI) Goldstar contractors to install comprehensive energy-efficient improvements.  The program is designed to use building science and a whole-house approach to reduce energy use in the State’s existing one-to-four family and low-rise multifamily residential buildings and capture heating fuel and electricity-related savings.  The Program provides incentives on eligible energy efficiency improvements including building shell measures, high efficiency heating and cooling measures, ENERGY STAR appliances and lighting. \r\n\r\nD I S C L A I M E R: Estimated Annual kWh Savings, Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings, and First Year Energy Savings $ Estimate represent contractor reported savings derived from energy modeling software calculations and not actual realized energy savings. The accuracy of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings for projects has been evaluated by an independent third party. The results of the impact analysis indicate that, on average, actual savings amount to 35 percent of the Estimated Annual kWh Savings and 65 percent of the Estimated Annual MMBtu Savings. The analysis did not evaluate every single project, but rather a sample of projects from 2007 and 2008, so the results are applicable to the population on average but not necessarily to any individual project which could have over or under achieved in comparison to the evaluated savings. The results from the impact analysis will be updated when more recent information is available. While many factors influence the degree to which estimated savings are realized, including the use of the modeling software itself, some reasons individual households may realize savings different from those projected include, but are not limited to, changes in the number or needs of members of a household, changes in occupancy schedules, changes in energy usage behaviors or appliances and electronics installed in the home, or beginning or ending a home business. In addition, the program has evolved since the last impact analysis, introducing a change in the mix of measures that are installed, and use of additional modeling software tools and protocols.  Further, with the current technology improvements and regulatory changes being considered we are actively working toward a more accurate future.
